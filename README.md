Authentication/Authorization, Cookies, Sessions and Routing system

This is a simple but powerfull example of user authentication and authorization. I will build some cookies, sessions and routing - and maybe some cache with Redis.

Be confortable in copy and paste codes from it. This is my first real open-source project and I hope you enjoy it. Follow the instruction below to install and test in your own machine

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 - I use some things in some version like nodejs (v16.13.0) and mysql.</li>
<li>2 - Run "npm i" to install all dependences like Prisma, Express, Typescript ❤️.</li>
<li>3 - Create .env file with follow properties:</li>
</ul>

DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/db_name"
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=yourCustomSecretToken
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=yourCustomRefreshToken


And DONE!
Simple like that (I hope)
